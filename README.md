# NLP (Natural Language Processing)
This repository consists of NLP notebooks implementing spam classification using different ML algorithms and python libraries.

Libraries used are scikit learn and gensim. 

Use below dataset files for corresting notebooks :- 

- "SMSSpamCollection" for nlp-rf.ipynb
- "spam.csv" for nlp-gensim.ipynb

My knowledge for NLP in these notebooks come from below sources and I believe they deserve the credit for that :- 

- Courses taken during my masters degree. 
- TensorFlow Developer course on Coursera
- NLP basics and Advanced NLP courses on LinkedIn.
